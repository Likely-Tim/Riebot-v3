Despite being a NEET and a shut in, Sora is extremely outgoing and confident, and is not afraid to play games with people face to face, even when they're cheating.

Bell was raised by his grandfather in a rural farming village deep within the mountains near the labyrinth city Orario. He had heard and read many stories about heroes from his grandfather, forming his dream of aspiring to be a mighty one himself. After his grandfather's death, he took it upon himself to leave the village, traveling to the land of Orario to fulfill his dreams. Upon his arrival in the city, Bell attempted to enter numerous Familia, but was rejected by each one. Hestia, a Goddess, unable to find members willing to join her Familia, asked him if he'd like to become the first member of her Familia. Bell gladly accepted, and so started his new life, finally with a Goddess' blessing.\\n\\nBell is a kind, straightforward, brave, yet shy boy who desires to be a hero like the ones he grew up reading about. He cares deeply for the people around him, especially his Goddess, Hestia, and his Familia. He considers them like family due to the death of his grandfather. Bell's goals didn't start out pure, as he wanted to be an adventurer in hopes of picking up girls, even thinking of starting a harem. However, after his experience with Ais and Bete, Bell seems to have forgone that dream and fell in love with Ais Wallenstein. He became determined to grow stronger so that he could be someone that could stand beside her. Ais saved Bell in an incident with a minotaur and that event made Bell fall in love with her and have fear of Minotaurs. \\n\\nBell is often scolded by people around him for his trusting nature. He was tricked out of his money by Naaza and Lili multiple times before he found out. In the latter's case, Hestia warned him that she may be untrustworthy; nevertheless, he still refused to abandon her. However, being the type to not hold grudges, he easily forgave both of them. When a body was discovered in the eighteenth floor and Ryuu was thought to be the murderer, he continually held doubts (despite mounting evidence seemingly pointing to her) and wanted to believe in her. Bell is also a terrible liar. His inability to lie or keep a secret is often easily recognized by others. It has been noted by Hestia that Bell has an extraordinary ability to read people. He recognized the loneliness in Lili to be similar to what he felt and was able to pick up on Lyd's feelings through his facial expressions fairly quickly. Though he gets flustered quite easily from time to time, especially around women, and can appear to be timid, Bell does possess a strong will. His feelings for Ais were strong enough to grant him a skill that highly accelerated his growth. His desire to be strong and stand next to her gave him the resolve to overcome his fear of Minotaurs and defeat one while still only a Level 1. He unknowingly went against Hermes's divine will and refused to kill Gros, choosing instead to believe in the dream of the Xenos and risk death. When he sets his mind to a goal, he puts his all towards completing it. He is the only adventurer to endure Eina's strict lessons, and he persisted through Ais's and Tiona's harsh training in preparation for the War Game against the Apollo Familia.\\n\\nBell often acts based on his feelings, causing him to be caught up in trouble, such as when he decided to help Lili, rescue Haruhime, and protect Wiene. However, such actions have also worked in his favor. His actions caused him to earn the affection of the aforementioned women, as well as several others. He saved Mord Latro, who had kidnapped Hestia and attacked Bell, from monsters, turning him from an enemy into an ally. His staunch support of the Xenos and his belief that they are worthy of being saved has made him extremely popular with them. His encounter with the Xenos deeply troubled him for a time. He was unsure if he could keep killing monsters, knowing that there were some that had the emotions and intelligence of people. With some advice from Fels, he decided to become a hypocrite: he would keep taking lives so that he could get stronger and protect others. Following his loss against Asterius and ascension to Level 4, Bell has become more calm and level-headed. Due to his goals now including creating a world that both people and Xenos could live in and defeating Asterius, his desire to be stronger has grown and he approaches adventures in the dungeon with more seriousness.\\n\",\"name\":{\"full\":\"Bell Cranel\"},\"id\":88860},\"media\":[{\"siteUrl\":\"https://anilist.co/anime/20920\",\"title\":{\"romaji\":\"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka\",\"english\":\"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?\"}},{\"siteUrl\":\"https://anilist.co/anime/21660\",\"title\":{\"romaji\":\"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka: Dungeon ni Onsen wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka\",\"english\":\"Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?: Is It Wrong to Expect a Hot Spring in a Dungeon?\"}},{\"siteUrl\":\"https://anilist.co/anime/21676\",\"title\":{\"romaji\":\"Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka Gaiden: Sword Oratoria\",\"english\":\"Sword Oratoria: Is it Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?

Sunshine!!\",\"type\":\"rich\",\"description\":\"Chika Takami, a self-proclaimed normal girl, has never been involved in any clubs and lacked any notable talents. However, after a visit to Tokyo, she discovers a stage where even an ordinary girl like her could shine—the world of school idols. Inspired by the former superstar school idol group μ's, Chika is determined to start her own school idol club in her seaside hometown at Uranohoshi Girl's High School. But even before gathering any students to join the group, the aspiring school idol finds her greatest obstacle to be student council president Dia Kurosawa who stands firmly against the creation of the club.\\n\\nJust when it seems there is no hope, Chika meets Riko Sakurauchi, a transfer student from Otonokizaka High School, home of μ's. Somewhat shy but a talented piano player, Chika believes her to be a promising recruit, though convincing her to join is easier said than done. In spite of that, Chika chooses to charge forward and overcome the obstacles keeping her from forming a school idol group that shines as bright as the nine that came before her.\\n\\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\",\"url\":\"https://myanimelist.net/anime/32526\",\"timestamp\":null,\"color\":2818303,\"fields\":[{\"name\":\"::notes: Opening Themes\",\"value\":\"#1: \\\"Aozora Jumping Heart (青空Jumping Heart)\\\" by Aqours\\n\",\"inline\":true},{\"name\":\"::notes: Ending Themes\",\"value\":\"#01: \\\"Kimeta yo Hand in Hand (決めたよHand in Hand)\\\" by Chika Takami (Anju Inami), Riko Sakurauchi (Rikako Aida) & You Watanabe (Shuka Saitou) (ep 1)\\n#02: \\\"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (ユメ語るよりユメ歌おう)\\\" by Chika Takami (Anju Inami), Riko Sakurauchi (Rikako Aida) & You Watanabe (Shuka Saitou) (ep 2)\\n#03: \\\"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (ユメ語るよりユメ歌おう)\\\" by Aqours (ep 3)\\n#04: \\\"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (ユメ語るよりユメ歌おう)\\\" by Hanamaru Kunikida (Kanako Takatsuki) & Ruby Kurosawa (Ai Furihata) (ep 4)\\n#05: \\\"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (ユメ語るよりユメ歌おう)\\\" by Yoshiko Tsushima (Aika Kobayashi) (ep 5)\\n#06: \\\"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (ユメ語るよりユメ歌おう)\\\" by Kanan Matsuura (Nanaka Suwa), Dia Kurosawa (Arisa Komiya) & Mari Ohara (Aina Suzuki) (ep 6)\\n#07: \\\"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (ユメ語るよりユメ歌おう)\\\" by Yoshiko Tsushima (Aika Kobayashi), Hanamaru Kunikida (Kanako Takatsuki) & Ruby Kurosawa (Ai Furihata) (ep 7)\\n#08: \\\"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (ユメ語るよりユメ歌おう)\\\" by 1st & 2nd Years (ep 8 )\\n#09: \\\"Yume Kataru yori Yume Utaou (ユメ語るよりユメ歌おう)\\\" by Chika Taka...\",\"inline\":true},{\"name\":\"​\",\"value\":\"​\",\"inline\":false},{\"name\":\"::trophy: Rank\",\"value\":\"➤ 2000\",\"inline\":true},{\"name\":\"::alarm_clock: Episodes\",\"value\":\"➤ 13\",\"inline\":true},{\"name\":\"::100: Rating\",\"value\":\"➤ 7.39\",\"inline\":true}],\"thumbnail\":{\"url\":\"https://api-cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/8/80791l.jpg\"},\"image\":null,\"author\":{\"name\":\"Sunrise\",\"icon_url\":\"https://image.myanimelist.net/ui/OK6W_koKDTOqqqLDbIoPAiC8a86sHufn_jOI-JGtoCQ\"},\"footer\":null},\"expires\":null}"}],["keyv:youtube_search",{"value":"{\"value\":\"\",\"expires\":null}"}]],"lastExpire":1632162080023}
