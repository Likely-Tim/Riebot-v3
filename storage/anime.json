She was a student in Class 3-1 of Katagiri Senior High School.\\n\\n__APPEARANCE__ \\nKyouko is a tall, slim girl with long, chestnut-brown hair and golden-brown eyes. Her hair is usually tied up when outside of school or in a casual setting. She is also known to be cute and pretty by most of her classmates. According to [Shin Yasuda](https://anilist.co/character/66975/Shin-Yasuda), she is a flat-chested girl. She has two notable outfits - her school uniform and her home outfit. Regarding her school uniform, Kyouko is most often seen donning her normal school uniform, which consists of a short-sleeved white shirt (long-sleeved in the winter), a red bow around her neck, a dark pleated skirt, black knee socks, and shoes. She occasionally wears her uniform vest, sweater, or blazer. As for her home outfit which she wears at home, Kyouko dresses in relatively casual and simple attire such as plain t-shirts and leggings or jeans. She keeps her hair tied up and at times, styled with hairpins. When cooking, she wears an apron. She also does not wear any makeup at home.\\n\\n__PERSONALITY__ \\nKyouko is normally a very energetic and popular person who always creates a happy atmosphere around herself. She is a hard-worker in all aspects of her life, and, according to Izumi Miyamura, she scores above 90% for all her tests. When nervous or embarrassed, she tends to switch to a violent state. This is seen when Kyousuke Hori asks if Miyamura was her boyfriend, resulting in her turning red and shoving a hot ladle into his face. Hori truly believes that \\\"only morons get sick over the summer\\\". She also appears to be slightly insecure about her loved ones leaving her. This is seen when Izumi Miyamura leaves to get her a sports drink and Hori calls out to him, saying \\\"Where are you going\\\". This is due because her mother and father would often be absent at vital times. \\n\\nEven though Kyouko also gets complimented for being cute, Kyouko does not believe she is cute because she does not get or act scared. She further adds that she doesn't do anything cute and how she is hopeless. This is seen when Kyouko abruptly leaves the movie and lays on her bed, believing it was her fault that Miyamura was not attracted to her. \\n\\nWhen she does ear cleaning, nail clipping, or massaging, she does it aggressively, which makes her feared by her family, her friends, and Miyamura. Miyamura has also mentioned in the chapter―that a Q-tip looks like a weapon with a considerable offense when Hori wields it. Kyousuke also refers to Kyouko as a \\\"fierce golem\\\".\\n\\n~!In chapter 43, or episode 8, it is shown that Hori is a sadist and somewhat of a masochist - however this is only when it comes to Miyamura. Whenever he suddenly flips his personality to that of an abusive boyfriend for a short while (at her request), Hori enjoys the treatment and feels refreshed afterward. This is probably due to the fact that Miyamura is always calm and non-abusive.!~\\n\\nShe is also shown to be very jealous at times girls are flirting with Miyamura to the point where [Yuki Yoshikawa](https://anilist.co/character/66963/Yuki-Yoshikawa) and [Tooru Ishikawa](https://anilist.co/character/66961/Tooru-Ishikawa) call her \\\"Ice Queen\\\". In some parts of the manga, she is also referred to as \\\"Hannya\\\" or the \\\"Goddess of Jealousy\\\". Over the course of the story, she does not seem to be too bothered with girls talking to Miyamura anymore but instead, worries that he might love a man. She once told him that it's okay to love another woman but not a man. \\n\\n~!In chapter 23, she confirms that she heard Miyamura's confession. At the end of the chapter, they hold hands, indicating that they are finally dating.!~ ~!In chapter 37, she calls Miyamura by his first name, 'Izumi', followed by the scene where they supposedly had sex, as evident in the next scenes, when Miyamura is shown with a bite on his nape as well as Hori being topless with Miyamura.!~\\n\",\"name\":{\"full\":\"Kyouko Hori\"},\"id\":66171},\"media\":[{\"siteUrl\":\"https://anilist.co/anime/14753\",\"title\":{\"romaji\":\"Hori-san to Miyamura-kun: Shingakki\",\"english\":null}}]},\"expires\":null}"}],["keyv:va_characters_3",{"value":"{\"value\":{\"role\":\"MAIN\",\"node\":{\"image\":{\"large\":\"https://s4.anilist.co/file/anilistcdn/character/large/b88889-CWYytVbCOPsV.png\"},\"siteUrl\":\"https://anilist.co/character/88889\",\"description\":\"**Race:** Raccoon & Tanuki\\n\\nRaphtalia is a Tanuki-type Demi-Human who was the first real member of the Shield Hero's party after he purchased her as a slave.\\n\\n~!Raphtalia later obtain one of the eight vassal weapons from another world granting her the title of Vassal Weapon Wielder and Katana Hero.
